This is a very basic libC using NASM.
I'm trying to write as many functions as I can.

In lib.c file you will find how to use each function (most of the examples come from the C doc).

How to compile :
nasm -f elf lib.asm
Warning : If you are using a 64bits OS, this may not works, if it is the case, compile the asm using 
nasm -f elf64 lib.asm 
This should work !

It will create a lib.o file which is required by the lib.c (or any applications other applications).
Then compile your file with gcc :
gcc lib.c lib.o -o lib
